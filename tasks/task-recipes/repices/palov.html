                    In Uzbekistan, there is a saying that guests can leave the
                    house only after they have tasted the pilaf prepared by the
                    owners. Pilaf or, as it is called in Uzbekistan - palov, is
                    a traditional dish that every resident of Uzbekistan should
                    be able to prepare.
